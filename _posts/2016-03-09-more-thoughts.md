Maybe it is time to blog more. But what is there to blog? There is a lot to blog. There is a lot to talk about. There are many thoughts. But there is a problem with those thoughts.

## Read, Think, Daydream ?

Many thoughts are raw. Many thoughts are incomplete. Many thoughts are naive. A lot of thoughts are also wrong. So what is the place for thoughts? Are only those thoughts fully thought through allowed to see the light of the sun? Should all other thoughts and ideas vanish (and maybe even get lost) in some diary on some table? 

Or is there a place, outside, in the wild, for those thoughts?

Not safe from feedback, not protected from criticism. Even exposed to some judgment?

Maybe a blog?
