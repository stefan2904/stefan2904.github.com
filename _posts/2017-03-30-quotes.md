The Elevate festival taking place in Graz every year always provides a lot of food for the brain. [This year](https://elevate.at/en/schedule/) it was all about data, and the algorithms processing it.

One topic discussed [on multiple panels](https://elevate.at/en/schedule/)  is the use of (big) data collected on social networks (like Facebook) to conduct (social) studies.  This often concerned the question whether it is possible to prove a hypothesis by just looking at data.

[Epistemology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology) ([Erkenntnistheorie](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erkenntnistheorie)) is a complex topic, but a topic worth thinking about. Especially as a scientist. 

During the [Autonomous Machines - Controlled People?](https://elevate.at/en/schedule/e17autonome/) panel, panelist [Claudia Wagner](https://elevate.at/en/speakers/wagner/) highlighted the difference between a *causal model* and a *statistical model*. A statistical model (data-driven model; like directly inferring from data) is looking for connections between datapoints: correlations. But [*correlation does not imply causation*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation). In contrast, a causal model is doing exactly that: Looking for the cause. Trying to explain. Making sure the effect was really caused by the found cause.

So for a statistical model to be of scientific value, there needs to be further research concerning the actual cause of the observed effect. This is often not happening in pure data-driven studies, because it is not easily possible.

*"Empirically observed covariation is a necessary but not sufficient condition for causality."* [[Tufte 2006]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation#Usage)
