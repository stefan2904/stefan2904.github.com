Since an increasing part of my community / *filter bubble* is not from the German-speaking parts of the world, I will from now on try to blog in English.

Furthermore, some thoughts in my brain are mostly formed out of English words, due to the nature of my fields of interest, [its](http://www.its-not-its.info/) communities and literature.

It's likely that the "target audience" of some thoughts speaks mostly German, though. So I am going to mix the language of this blog from time to time.

We will see.
