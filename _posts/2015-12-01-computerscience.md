I am a student of *Computer Science*. But what is that actually, *Computer Science*?

A first definition that comes to my mind: *Computer Science* is the science of information. *Computer Science* is the science (or art?) of storing and processing information.

But let's see how others define this ...

> **computer science**
> *[noun]*
> the study of the principles and use of computers. [[Google](https://www.google.at/search?q=define:computer+science)]

Boring. Let's see some more definitions.

> the branch of engineering science that studies (with the aid of computers) computable processes and structures [[Wolfram|Alpha](http://wolfr.am/8DrljJbU)]

> the science that deals with the theory and methods of processing information in digital computers, the design of computer hardware and software, and the applications of computers. [[Dictionary.com](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/computer-science)]


> Computer science is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications. 
> It is the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures (or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to information. [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science)]


> An alternate, more succinct definition of computer science is the study of automating algorithmic processes that scale. [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science)]
